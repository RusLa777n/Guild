We built Guild (https://guild.xyz/) to enable interoperable token gating anywhere on the web. By integrating our technology you are invited to participate in our evolving network and potentially onboard the 100k+ users already using Guild to your app.

Why Guild? We are laser focused on one thing, which is membership management in communities. We built a piece of infrastructure in an as non-presumptuous way as possible, enabling cross-chain and cross-platform token gating. In our vision the future of the internet is composable and interoperable with building blocks which are easy to use, do the thing they are supposed to do exceptionally and are easy to integrate into any environment. Guild is one of these building blocks.

With the power of establishing roles around on- or off-chain requirements you can either replicate your existing membership structures on Guild to enable portability of community structures or create members-only areas on your website or in your app. Or something else you might think of. We like to be surprised with what you can build with our SDK.

To start with here docs ( https://docs.guild.xyz/guild) and our SDK ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/@guildxyz/sdk).
